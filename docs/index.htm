	<h2>WEB 215 - Our Members (hurry up and add yourself already></h2>
	<p> If you're reading this and don't know what to do, do this:</p>
	<ol>

		<li>
			go to the readme file for http://github.com/divonbriesen/CP_WEB215_SP2020 and make sure you've accepted the invitation to collaborate, and marked yourself as present. Update the links to your github profile and to your repo for this class. 
		</li>
		<li>
			install a github client on your computer. your teacher is using github desktop for windows, but also has used sourcetree.
		</li>
		<li>
			clone the master repo (the one this page is in) - http://github.com/divonbriesen/CP_WEB215_SP2020 to your Computer
		</li>
		<li>
			use your editor (notepad++ or give visual studio code a try- that's what your teacher is using and it'll help you go faster) to add your information to the index page in a similar format to the examples already there. You can tidy any/all up, but do it consistently. They should all be formatted identically though the content will be different. 
		</li>
		<li>
			save your work, look at it locally (i.e. in a browser window on your computer) and edit/save until you are happy with what you see.
		</li>
		<li>
			commit your work in the github client, push origin in the github client, then view the page on github pages (http://divonbriesen.github.io/CP_WEB215_SP2020/). Note this format - in my case it reroutes the domain name to a name i setup, but it's the same. (i.e. divonbriesen.github.io = wesome.us)
		</li>
		<li>note: since others will be editing on and off it's important to commit and push often, to avoid conflicts. Pull origin just before your start working, and push origin when done. If you were to make a change, then push it 8 hours later, it's likely someone else will have made a change as well and you'll get a merge conflict. 
		</li>

	</ol>

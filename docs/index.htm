	<h2>WEB 215 - Our Members (hurry up and add yourself already)</h2>
	<h3>Start by reading this:</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Go to the readme file for http://github.com/divonbriesen/CP_WEB215_SP2020 and make sure you've accepted
			the invitation to collaborate, and marked yourself as present. Update the links to your github profile
			and to your repo for this class.
		</li>
		<li>
			Install a github client on your computer. your teacher is using github desktop for windows, but also has
			used sourcetree.
		</li>
		<li>
			Clone the master repo (the one this page is in) - http://github.com/divonbriesen/CP_WEB215_SP2020 to
			your Computer
		</li>
		<li>
			Use your editor (notepad++ or give visual studio code a try- that's what your teacher is using and it'll
			help you go faster) to add your information to the index page in a similar format to the examples
			already there. You can tidy any/all up, but do it consistently. They should all be formatted identically
			though the content will be different.
		</li>
		<li>
			Save your work, look at it locally (i.e. in a browser window on your computer) and edit/save until you
			are happy with what you see.
		</li>
		<li>
			Commit your work in the github client, push origin in the github client, then view the page on github
			pages (http://divonbriesen.github.io/CP_WEB215_SP2020/ or http://wesome.us/CP_WEB2015_SP2020/). Note this format - in my case it reroutes the
			domain name to a name i setup, but it's the same. (i.e. divonbriesen.github.io = wesome.us)
		</li>
		<li>
			Since others will be editing on and off it's important to commit and push often, to avoid
			conflicts. Pull origin just before your start working, and push origin when done. If you were to make a
			change, then push it 8 hours later, it's likely someone else will have made a change as well and you'll
			get a merge conflict. <strong>Using Visual Studio Code will help because it'll let you resolve conflicts within the editor!</strong>
		</li>
		<li>
			As you become a more advanced developer, you will want to view your pages via a webserver, rather than just opening them locally in a
			browser. If you install xampp on your computer, you can run an Apache (the A in XAMPP) webserver - be sure to put your web files in the
			htdocs folder inside the xampp folder - then you can browse to the page using http://localhost/whateverfolderyoucreated/whateveryourfileiscalled - so
			for example, in this class, a local webserver url could be: http://localhost/CP_WEB215_SP2020/
		</li>
		<li>
			On github you can make any repository into a simple webserver (no php, but JS will work) - using settings, and the github pages block. I
			recommend making a docs folder inside your repo and using that- to distinguish from other files you may not want on the website.
		</li>
	</ol>

                                 			THIS IS THE TEMPLATE

If you are new to this page and creating your template, copy and paste the below code. Start with the comment where your name
goes, right above <section class="usersection"> element and end at the bottom </div> element. Find where your name is in
alphabetical order with your FIRST name. Then paste the template code where it belongs. After you have pasted and edited your
code, go back up to the <nav> and fix the code accordingly so that every user has the right placeholder. This will involve
going back through the code and checking the placeholder in the actual section of the other users. PLEASE BE CAREFUL NOT TO DELETE
OTHER USERS. CHECK AND RECHECK.

BEFORE YOU COMMIT AND PUSH BACK TO THE MASTER BRANCH, RUN THIS INDEX.HTML FILE LOCALLY TO MAKE SURE IT IS CORRECT AND THE
<NAV> (PLACEHOLDERS) MATCH EACH SECTION OF THE USERS AND ALL THE NAMES ARE IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER.

			Not funny, but motivational :) I really believe in the Power of Thoughts and I have proof. I've been dreaming to
			move to the USA since I was 12, but knew it was close to impossible. So I found a picture of a green card, photoshopped
			it with my own photo and information, printed it out and hung on the wall. I looked at that green card every day dreaming
			about getting one and...I did! I won the Lottery! (it's less than 1 % chance of winning, so you know how great it is).

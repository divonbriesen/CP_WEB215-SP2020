		<h2>WEB 215 - Our Members (hurry up and add yourself already></h2>
		<p> If you're reading this and don't know what to do, do this:</p>
		<ol>

			<li>
				go to the readme file for http://github.com/divonbriesen/CP_WEB215_SP2020 and make sure you've accepted
				the invitation to collaborate, and marked yourself as present. Update the links to your github profile
				and to your repo for this class.
			</li>
			<li>
				install a github client on your computer. your teacher is using github desktop for windows, but also has
				used sourcetree.
			</li>
			<li>
				clone the master repo (the one this page is in) - http://github.com/divonbriesen/CP_WEB215_SP2020 to
				your Computer
			</li>
			<li>
				use your editor (notepad++ or give visual studio code a try- that's what your teacher is using and it'll
				help you go faster) to add your information to the index page in a similar format to the examples
				already there. You can tidy any/all up, but do it consistently. They should all be formatted identically
				though the content will be different.
			</li>
			<li>
				save your work, look at it locally (i.e. in a browser window on your computer) and edit/save until you
				are happy with what you see.
			</li>
			<li>
				commit your work in the github client, push origin in the github client, then view the page on github
				pages (http://divonbriesen.github.io/CP_WEB215_SP2020/). Note this format - in my case it reroutes the
				domain name to a name i setup, but it's the same. (i.e. divonbriesen.github.io = wesome.us)
			</li>
			<li>note: since others will be editing on and off it's important to commit and push often, to avoid
				conflicts. Pull origin just before your start working, and push origin when done. If you were to make a
				change, then push it 8 hours later, it's likely someone else will have made a change as well and you'll
				get a merge conflict.
			</li>

		</ol>

				<li><span class="category">Personal Background:</span>
					I was born and raised in Russia, but always believed that I did not belong there. So I moved to the States 3 years ago. I have a 7-year-old daughter and a 2-year-old cat.
				</li>
				<li><span class="category">Professional/Academic Background:</span>
					I work full-time as a purchasing specialist in an Austrian company. It's my second year in CPCC, I am happy to be back after my 2-semester break.
				</li>
				<li><span class="category">Information/Technology background:</span>
					 I took programmer classes when I was 14 years old, but was not interested in being a programmer at all, so I've never used any of my knowledge. As a result I am an advanced PC user, but not more than that. When I moved to the States I started thinking about changing my career path and I ended up choosing computers!

				<li><span class="category">Primary Computer Platform:</span> macOS Mojave at home and Windows 10 at work.

					<span class="category">Something to remember me by:</span>  Not funny, but motivational :) I really believe in the Power of Thoughts and I have proof. I've been dreaming to move to the USA since I was 12, but knew it was close to impossible. So I found a picture of a green card, photoshopped it with my own photo and information, printed it out and hung on the wall. I looked at that green card every day dreaming about getting one and...I did! I won the Lottery! (it's less than 1 % chance of winning, so you know how great it is).

					<span class="category">I would also like to share:</span> Recently decided to be more active on Instagram - but understand that being a blogger is a hard work!
